# GLMath
## About
GLMath, also known as `glmath`, is a small C library that provides developers with useful types and compute functions for graphics-related purposes. Use cases can include working with a graphics library such as OpenGL, or simply needing to work with multi-dimensional data.
## Features
Including `glmath/vector.h` gives us some basic types, along with functions for working with the types.
Here's a list of types from `glmath/vector.h`:
* The `GLMvec2` type, which allows us to store 2-dimensional data.
* The `GLMvec3` type, which allows us to store 3-dimensional data.
* The `GLMvec4` type, which allows us to store 4-dimensional data.
And here's a list of functions from `glmath/vector.h`:
* The `glmath_vec2_add` function, which allows us to add 2-dimensional values.
* The `glmath_vec2_subtract` function, which allows us to subtract 2-dimensional values, and store the result in a seperate 2-dimensional object.
* The `glmath_vec2_scale` function, which allows us to scale a 2-dimensional value.
* The `glmath_vec2_dot` function allows us to obtain the dot product of two 2-dimensional values.
